Chen, Heng (陈  衡) is a M.S. student, majored in plant genetic and breeding, at {{< staticref "http://www.igahrb.cas.cn/rcjs/zg/index_89519.html?json=http://sourcedb.neigaehrb.cas.cn/zw/zjrc/202112/t20211201_6283837.json" "newtab" >}}Zhang lab{{< /staticref >}} and {{< staticref "http://www.igahrb.cas.cn/rcjs/zg/index_89519.html?json=http://sourcedb.neigaehrb.cas.cn/zw/zjrc/202112/t20211201_6283887.json" "newtab" >}}Liu lab{{< /staticref >}} of IGA, CAS. His current research focuses on understanding the quantitative traits in soybean, including isoflavones, protein and oil. Two approaches are utilized to develop the research: QTL mapping and dynamic transcriptome analysis. The meta-analysis was used in his research as an assistant tool, as well. His research interests include quantitative genetics, RNA biology, epigenetics and bioinfomatics. He also has a passion for sports, especially football and basketball, who has been adoring FC Barcelona and Los Angeles Lakers for fourteen years. Mr. Chen always proclaims himself a marxist, though he has read only a few chapters of "Selected Works of Mao Tse-Tung" and "Das Kapital".
