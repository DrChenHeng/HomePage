His current research focuses on understanding the molecular mechanisms of DNA methylation and histone modifications dynamically regulating plant development and adaptation to environments. He also investigated the quantitative traits (such as isoflavones, protein and oil) in soybean via using the QTL mapping, transcriptome analysis and meta-analysis. Additionally, Mr. Chen' s research interests also include bioinformatics, gene editing, RNA secondary structure, photomorphosis and domestication. He has a passion for sports as well, especially football and basketball, who has been adoring FC Barcelona and Los Angeles Lakers for fourteen years. Mr. Chen always proclaims himself a marxist, though he has read only a few chapters of {{< staticref "https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/mao/selected-works/index.htm" "newtab" >}}Selected Works of Mao Tse-Tung{{< /staticref >}} and {{< staticref "https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch01.htm" "newtab" >}}Das Kapital{{< /staticref >}}.
